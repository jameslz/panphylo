# panphylo: Construction phylogenetic tree using genome or amino acid sequences

1. core gene alignment and snp calling using snp-sites.

2. mash distance and upgma tree.

3. cgMLST using PubMLST scheme to generate distance matrix, splittree for Neighbor-Net phylogenetic network.

4. orthofinder to infer species tree.
